    "3. What is the most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list?\n",
    "3A.In list we can access elements by indexes, but in dictionary we can not access by indexes it means list elements are ordered whereas dictionary elements are unordered.\n",

    "4A.It will give you KeyError as key not found.\n",

    "5. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.keys()?\n",
    "5A.There is no difference. The in operator checks whether a value exists as a key in the dictionary.\n",
